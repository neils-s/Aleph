# Aleph
A C# implementation of the Aleph algorithm

The Aleph algorithm is a distributed, decentralized, byzantine-fault-tolerant concensus algorithm created by the AlephZero foundation.
For more information on the AlephZero Foundation, see their website:  https://alephzero.org/ and http://aleph-zero.org/

I am not associated with the very smart folks over at the AlephZero Foundation.  I'm just someone who is very impressed by their algorithm and I'm interested in seeing it made widely available to .Net programmers.  Any mistakes found in this implementation of the algorithm are my own, and any effeciencies are solely the result of the mathematicians and computer scientists over at AlephZero.

The primary source should be the peer-reviewed paper that describes the protocol.  This can be found here:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05156
For historical reference, the preprint version of this same paper can be found on ArXiv here:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05256

The Aleph Zero project has a python proof-of-concept on GitHub here:  https://github.com/alephzerofoundation/Proof-of-Concept

This project will be developed under the LGPL v3 license.  This is the same open-source license that the Aleph Zero Foundation chose to use for their Python Proof-of-Concept project.
