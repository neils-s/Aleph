# Aleph
A C# implementation of the Aleph algorithm

The Aleph algorithm is a distributed, decentralized, byzantine-fault-tolerant concensus algorithm created by the AlephZero foundation.
For more information on the AlephZero Foundation, see their website:  https://alephzero.org/ and http://aleph-zero.org/

The primary source should be the protocol whitepaper, which can be found on ArXiv here:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05256

The Aleph Zero project has a python proof-of-concept on GitHub here:  https://github.com/alephzerofoundation/Proof-of-Concept

This project will be developed under the LGPL v3 license.  This is the same open-source license that the Aleph Zero Foundation chose to use for their Python Proof-of-Concept project.
