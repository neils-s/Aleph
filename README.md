# Aleph
A C# implementation of the Aleph algorithm

The Aleph algorithm is a distributed, decentralized, byzantine-fault-tolerant concensus algorithm created by the AlephZero foundation.
For more information on the AlephZero Foundation, see their website:  https://alephzero.org/ and http://aleph-zero.org/

The primary source should be the protocol whitepaper, which can be found on ArXiv here:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05256

This project will be developed under an open-source, but the AlephZero team hasn't settled on a specific license, so I don't want to commit to any specific license, yet.
